### [2026-02-12] experiments/ folder proposal accepted

**Type:** Notification
**Priority:** Medium
**Source:** DSM Central

Your proposal (Sprint 6, Entry 28 / Proposal #23) to add `experiments/` to the
DSM 4.0 project structure template has been accepted.

**Decision:** The canonical location is `data/experiments/`, matching Section 4.4
(Tests vs Capability Experiments). DSM 4.0 Section 2.2 has been updated to include
this folder in the project structure template.

**Action required:** Move your current `experiments/` folder to `data/experiments/`
to align with the canonical structure. Update any imports or references accordingly.
