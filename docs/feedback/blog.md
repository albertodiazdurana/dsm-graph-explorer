## Comparison: NLP Project vs. This Project

**NLP Project (retrospective blog):**
- Blog written after project completion
- Had to reconstruct story from memory and artifacts
- No structured materials preparation
- Captured in dsm-feedback-blog.md after the fact

**This Project (planned blog):**
- Blog materials prepared upfront
- Journal captures observations during implementation
- Structured outline guides narrative
- Following Section 2.5.6 process end-to-end

**Question to answer at end:** Which approach produced a better blog with less effort?
