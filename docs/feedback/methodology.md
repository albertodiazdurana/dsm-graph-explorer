# DSM Feedback: Methodology Effectiveness

**Project:** DSM Graph Explorer
**Purpose:** Record which DSM guidance was used and evaluate its effectiveness for software engineering projects.

**Reference:** Section 6.4.5 (Project Feedback Deliverables) — File 2 of 3

---

## Instructions

Track:
- **Which DSM sections were referenced** during each phase
- **Effectiveness scoring** (1-5 scale: 1=Not helpful, 5=Extremely helpful)
- **What worked well** and **what needs improvement**
- **Observations** on DSM 4.0 applicability to software engineering

This helps assess whether DSM 4.0 is effective for dog-fooding (building DSM tooling with DSM methodology).

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Extremely helpful — Clear, actionable, perfectly matched the need |
| 4 | Very helpful — Good guidance with minor gaps |
| 3 | Moderately helpful — Useful but required adaptation |
| 2 | Somewhat helpful — Vague or incomplete guidance |
| 1 | Not helpful — Missing, unclear, or irrelevant |

## Phase 0: Environment Setup

**Date:** 2026-01-31

| DSM Section Referenced | Score (1-5) | What Worked Well | What Needs Improvement |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| DSM 4.0 Section 2 (Project Structure Patterns) | 5 | Clear distinction between DSM 1.0 vs DSM 4.0 patterns; easy to follow | _None so far_ |
| Section 2.5.6 (Blog/Communication Deliverable Process) | 5 | Materials template provided structure upfront; prevented technical debt | _None so far_ |
| Section 6.4.5 (Project Feedback Deliverables) | 5 | Three-file feedback system is clear and well-documented | _None so far_ |

**Observations:**
- DSM 4.0 Section 2 (just added in v1.3.18) was immediately useful for this project
- Blog materials preparation upfront (Section 2.5.6) works well to avoid accumulating blog debt
- Having DSM 4.0 for software engineering makes dog-fooding smooth

## Sprint 1: Parser MVP

**Date:** 2026-02-01

| DSM Section Referenced | Score (1-5) | What Worked Well | What Needs Improvement |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| DSM 4.0 Section 3 (Development Protocol) | 4 | TDD workflow guidance was clear and effective | Missing pre-generation brief step for human-AI collaboration (added as feedback) |
| DSM 4.0 Section 2 (Project Structure Patterns) | 4 | Clear folder structure guidance | Feedback files specified as loose files inconsistent with subfolder pattern (added as feedback) |
| Section 6.4 (Checkpoint and Feedback Protocol) | 5 | Three-file feedback system worked well; checkpoint template captured all state | _None_ |
| Section 2.5.6 (Blog/Communication Process) | 5 | Journal capture during sprint produced rich material; dog-fooding narrative emerged naturally | _None_ |

**Observations:**
- DSM 4.0 Development Protocol works well for TDD but needs a collaboration step (pre-generation brief) before artifact creation
- Short sprint cadence (not in DSM) proved more effective than monolithic sprint — produced 4 feedback items in one sprint
- Research-first grounding (Phase 0.5, not in DSM) validated the approach against published best practices before implementation
- Dog-fooding surfaced methodology gaps that theoretical review would not have found
