## Usage

Created at end of session if work is incomplete. Contains:
- What was done
- What's next
- Open questions
- How to resume

**Note:** For longer breaks, use checkpoints/ instead. Handoffs are for short session boundaries.

## Cross-Repo Guides

Some handoffs (like `wsl_migration_guide.md`) are designed to be applicable across multiple projects and can be copied to other repositories.
