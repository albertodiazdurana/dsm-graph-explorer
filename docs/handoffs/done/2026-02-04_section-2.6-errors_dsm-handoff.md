**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Date Completed:** 2026-02-23
**Outcome Reference:** Consumed at Session 15 start
**Type:** Error remediation handoff
**From:** DSM Graph Explorer
**To:** DSM Repository maintainers
**Priority:** Medium (6 genuine broken references)

---

## Summary

After fixing the trailing period parser bug, dsm-graph-explorer now reports **6 genuine broken references** in the DSM repository. All 6 reference **Section 2.6**, which does not exist.

## Validation Command

```bash
dsm-validate D:\data-science\agentic-ai-data-science-methodology
```

## Errors to Fix

| # | File | Line | Reference | Action Needed |
|---|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | CHANGELOG.md | 30 | Section 2.6 | Update or remove |
| 2 | CHANGELOG.md | 134 | Section 2.6 | Update or remove |
| 3 | CHANGELOG.md | 658 | Section 2.6 | Update or remove |
| 4 | DSM_0_START_HERE_Complete_Guide.md | 194 | Section 2.6 | Update to correct section |
| 5 | DSM_1.0_Data_Science_Collaboration_Methodology_v1.1.md | 480 | Section 2.6 | Update to correct section |
| 6 | DSM_1.0_Data_Science_Collaboration_Methodology_v1.1.md | 525 | Section 2.6 | Update to correct section |

## Context

Section 2.6 does not exist in the current DSM structure. The references likely point to:
- A section that was renumbered during DSM evolution
- A section that was removed or merged
- An incorrect section number

## Recommended Fix Approach

1. **For CHANGELOG.md entries:**
   - These may be historical references that were valid at the time
   - Option A: Leave as-is with a note that section was later renumbered
   - Option B: Update to point to the current equivalent section
   - Option C: Remove the reference if the content is no longer relevant

2. **For DSM_0 and DSM_1.0:**
   - Identify what the reference was intended to point to
   - Update to the correct current section number
   - Verify the reference context still makes sense

## How to Verify Fix

After making corrections, re-run validation:

```bash
dsm-validate D:\data-science\agentic-ai-data-science-methodology --strict
```

Expected result: `0 errors, 0 warnings`
