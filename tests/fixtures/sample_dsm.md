# 1 Introduction

This is the first section of the sample DSM document.

## 1.1 Overview & Purpose

This methodology provides a systematic framework. See Section 2.4.8 for details.

### 1.1.1 Communication Style

Concise responses with direct answers.

### 1.1.2 Project Structure Philosophy

Phased approach following DSM_4.0 guidelines.

## 1.2 When to Use This Methodology

For data science projects. Reference: DSM 1.0 Section 3.5.

# 2 Project Phases

## 2.1 Phase 0: Environment Setup

See Appendix A.1 for environment details.

### 2.1.1 Package Installation

Install packages as described in Appendix A.1.1.

## 2.2 Phase 1: Data Pipeline

Cross-reference: Section 2.1.1 and Appendix B.2.4.

### 2.2.1 Data Loading

Multiple references: Section 1.1, Appendix D.2.7, and DSM_1.0 Section 2.

## 2.3 Phase 2: Core Modules

Reference DSM_0 for alignment guidance.

# 3 Advanced Topics

## 3.1 Testing Approach

See Section 4.4 for tests vs capability experiments.

```python
# This is a code block - references here should be skipped
# Section 99.99 should NOT be extracted
# See Appendix Z.99 for fake reference
# DSM_99.0 is not real
result = parse("Section 1.1")
```

After the code block, Section 3.1 references should resume.

## 3.2 Performance Optimization

See Section 2.2.1 and Appendix C.1.3 for guidance.

```
Another code block without language specifier.
Section 88.88 should be ignored.
Appendix Y.1 should be ignored.
```

# 4 Deep Nesting Test

## 4.1 Level Two

### 4.1.1 Level Three

#### 4.1.1.1 Level Four

This tests deep nesting up to level 4.

# Appendix A: Environment Setup Details

## A.1 Base Environment

### A.1.1 Package List and Rationale

Details about packages.

## A.2 Advanced Environment

Reference: Section 2.1 for setup steps.

# Appendix B: Phase Deep Dives

## B.1 Phase 0 Details

## B.2 Phase 1 Details

### B.2.1 Data Loading Strategies

### B.2.4 EDA Techniques by Data Type

Cross-reference: See Section 2.2 for overview.

# Appendix D: Domain Adaptations

## D.1 Time Series

## D.2 NLP

### D.2.7 Embedding Visualization

See DSM 4.0 Section 14 for repository setup.

# Edge Cases Section

## No Number Heading

This heading has no section number.

## 6.1. Trailing Period Format

DSM uses trailing periods in section numbers.

### 6.1.1. Nested Trailing Period

This tests nested sections with trailing periods.

## E.1. Appendix Trailing Period

Appendix sections can also have trailing periods.

## 5.1 Orphan Subsection

This subsection has no parent section 5.

## Heading with extra   spaces

Extra whitespace in the heading.

Section 2.4.8 appears twice: once here and once in Section 1.1 above.
DSM_4.0 and DSM 1.0 are both referenced on this line.
